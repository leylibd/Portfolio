        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodivergent disorder.
          The main characteristics often are:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li>communication problems;</li>
          <li>limited motor skills;</li>
          <li>difficulties in reading emotions;</li>
          <li>attention and focus problems;</li>
          <li>difficulties in relating to people, things and events;</li>
          <li>difficulties in interacting with people;</li>
          <li>
            repetitive body motions and behaviour like repeating sounds or
            phrases;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Many children with ASD require an environment that is calm, with clear
          and familiar structures, and learning activities that can be
          customized to their needs [1].
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="literature-review">
        <h2>Literature review</h2>
        <p>
          During the last few decades, computer technologies have been used as a
          supporting tool to enhance learning and motivation of kids with ASD.
          Prior research shows that usage of technologies has a positive effect
          on kids with ASD. ‘Parents and clinicians regularly report that
          children with autism are drawn to technological devices’ (Goldsmith &
          LeBlanc, 2004: 166). Multiple studies state that kids with autism
          often have unusual interest in sensory interactions: compared to
          verbal output and rewards, sensory rewards provide more positive
          reaction and result in significant increase in verbal initiations [2,
          9]. Other studies have found that instructions that were given through
          computers have positive affect on kids with ASD and result in
          increased motivation, attention and learning and decreased
          inappropriate behaviour [2]. Moreover, integration of tangible user
          interfaces into behavioral therapies resulted in “positive effects for
          simulating attention, shortening duration of solitary activities and
          lowering arousal” (Zhiglova, 2018).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Lahm (1996) conducted an initial investigation into the impact of
          software features in commercially available programs on engagement,
          affect, and choice. 48 alternating treatment design studies found that
          children with disabilities like autism prefer programs with more
          interactive elements, such as animation, sound, and voice. These
          programs resulted in more positive emotions and more frequent
          engagement with the computer. The children were also observed to make
          choices based on their preferences for these interactive features [2,
          3].
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently there are different apps available in the market that are
          focused on the needs of children with autism [1]:
        </p>
        <br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>App name</th>
            <th>Platform</th>
            <th>Skill Focus</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Big Blue Box Farm</td>
            <td>iPad, iPhone</td>
            <td>
              Assists in cognitive development, social development and motor
              skills through puzzle
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>I Get…Cooking</td>
            <td>iPad, iPhone</td>
            <td>Improves constructive skills through cooking game</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>The Photo Cookbook - Quick & easy</td>
            <td>iPad, iPhone</td>
            <td>Improves cognitive skills</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, during one study, a prototype of Interactive Carpet was
          created using smart textiles. The soft textile of this prototype
          allowed kids with autism to interact and manipulate with it in various
          ways, such as folding and squeezing. Range of activities with
          multi-sensory feedback help to enhance attention and social skills and
          promote the interaction between caregiver and a child [6].

          My goal is to create an interactive digital system for children with

        <br />
        <ul class="bullet-points">

      <section id="conceptual-model">
        <h2>Conceptual Model</h2>
        <p>
          Interactive Cubes is an interactive system that helps children between
          the age of 5-10 with low functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder develop
          their motor, cognitive and social skills together with their parents.
          It comes with a mobile app where parents can select different
          activities and tasks for their child.
        </p>
        <br />
        <section class="text-with-image">
          <p>
            An AI that is integrated in the app and trained by professional
            psychologists, will tailor activities to meet individual needs of
            the child. It will set goals and track the process. After each
            activity, parent can complete a quiz on what they noticed in child's
            behaviour during the activity. They can also write down their
            observations so AI can learn more about a child and consider these
            things in building upcoming activities. Before using the app,
            parents will need to answer a set of questions about the child’s
            state so that AI can tailor the activities according to it.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, this system is not meant to replace actual applied
            behavioral therapy. Rather, it can be used as a tool that makes it
            easier for parents to spend time with their children by learning and
            playing.

        <section id="decription">
          <h2>Description of the cubes</h2>
          <p>
            Each cube has a electrostatic sensory display on top, where the
            images for activities will be displayed. The display will also be
            used to explore different textures through tactile sensation. Other
            components of the cube are speakers and microphone. The cube is
            hollow inside.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Interaction</h3>
          <p>
            Before the start of the activities, a parent will open each cube
            that will be involved in the task-based activities and put a small
            reward inside. It can be whatever child likes, for example, their
            favorite candy, toy, etc.
            <br />
            Parent selects an activity in the app, for example, image
            recognition. An app shows a certain image and parent tells them to
            find a cube with this it.
            <br />
            **Right answer:**
            <br />
            If a child touches the right cube, one side of this cube will open
            and they will get a small reward, praising them for a correct answer
            and thereby creating a positive reinforcement. Example video of the
            prototype: /////PASTE VIDEO
            <br />
            **Wrong answer:**
            <br />
            If a child touches a wrong cube, cube will vibrate and won’t give a
            reward (aversive stimulus).
