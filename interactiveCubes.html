        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodivergent disorder.
          The main characteristics often are:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul class="bullet-points">
          <li>communication problems;</li>
          <li>limited motor skills;</li>
          <li>difficulties in reading emotions;</li>
          <li>attention and focus problems;</li>
          <li>difficulties in relating to people, things and events;</li>
          <li>difficulties in interacting with people;</li>
          <li>
            repetitive body motions and behaviour like repeating sounds or
            phrases;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Many children with ASD require an environment that is calm, with clear
          and familiar structures, and learning activities that can be
          customized to their needs <a class="ref" href="#r1">[1]</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <br />
      <section class="literature-review">
        <h2>Literature review</h2>
        <p>
          During the last few decades, computer technologies have been used as a
          supporting tool to enhance learning and motivation of kids with ASD.
          Prior research shows that usage of technologies has a positive effect
          on kids with ASD. ‘Parents and clinicians regularly report that
          children with autism are drawn to technological devices’
          <a class="ref" href="#r2">(Goldsmith & LeBlanc, 2004: 166)</a>
          . Multiple studies state that kids with autism often have unusual
          interest in sensory interactions: compared to verbal output and
          rewards, sensory rewards provide more positive reaction and result in
          significant increase in verbal initiations
          <a class="ref" href="#r2">[2]</a> <a class="ref" href="#r9">[9]</a>.
          Other studies have found that instructions that were given through
          computers have positive affect on kids with ASD and result in
          increased motivation, attention and learning and decreased
          inappropriate behaviour <a class="ref" href="#r2">[2]</a>. Moreover,
          integration of tangible user interfaces into behavioral therapies
          resulted in “positive effects for simulating attention, shortening
          duration of solitary activities and lowering arousal”
          <a class="ref" href="#r6">(Zhiglova, 2018)</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <a class="ref" href="#r3">Lahm (1996)</a> conducted an initial
          investigation into the impact of software features in commercially
          available programs on engagement, affect, and choice. 48 alternating
          treatment design studies found that children with disabilities like
          autism prefer programs with more interactive elements, such as
          animation, sound, and voice. These programs resulted in more positive
          emotions and more frequent engagement with the computer. The children
          were also observed to make choices based on their preferences for
          these interactive features <a class="ref" href="#r2">[2]</a>
          <a class="ref" href="#r3">[3]</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently there are different apps available in the market that are
          focused on the needs of children with autism
          <a class="ref" href="#r1">[1]</a>:

          </tr>
        </table>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, during one study, a prototype of Interactive Carpet was
          created using smart textiles. The soft textile of this prototype
          allowed kids with autism to interact and manipulate with it in various
          ways, such as folding and squeezing. Range of activities with
          multi-sensory feedback help to enhance attention and social skills and
          promote the interaction between caregiver and a child

        <br />
      </section>
      <section id="conceptual-model">
        <h2>Conceptual Model</h2>
        <p>
          Interactive Cubes is an interactive system that helps children between
          the age of 5-10 with low functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder develop
          their motor, cognitive and social skills together with their parents.
          It comes with a mobile app where parents can select different
          activities and tasks for their child.
        </p>
        <br />
        <section class="text-with-image">
          <p>
            An AI that is integrated in the app and trained by professional
            psychologists, will tailor activities to meet individual needs of
            the child. It will set goals and track the process. After each
            activity, parent can complete a quiz on what they noticed in child's
            behaviour during the activity. They can also write down their
            observations so AI can learn more about a child and consider these
            things in building upcoming activities. Before using the app,
            parents will need to answer a set of questions about the child’s
            state so that AI can tailor the activities according to it.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, this system is not meant to replace actual applied
            behavioral therapy. Rather, it can be used as a tool that makes it
            easier for parents to spend time with their children by learning and
            playing.

        <section id="decription">
          <h2>Description of the cubes</h2>
          <p>
            Each cube has a electrostatic sensory display on top, where the
            images for activities will be displayed. The display will also be
            used to explore different textures through tactile sensation. Other
            components of the cube are speakers and microphone. The cube is
            hollow inside.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Interaction</h3>
          <p>
            Before the start of the activities, a parent will open each cube
            that will be involved in the task-based activities and put a small
            reward inside. It can be whatever child likes, for example, their
            favorite candy, toy, etc.
            <br />
            Parent selects an activity in the app, for example, image
            recognition. An app shows a certain image and parent tells them to
            find a cube with this it.
            <br />
            Right answer:
            <br />
            If a child touches the right cube, one side of this cube will open
            and they will get a small reward, praising them for a correct answer
            and thereby creating a positive reinforcement. Example video of the
            prototype: /////PASTE VIDEO
            <br />
            Wrong answer:
            <br />
            If a child touches a wrong cube, cube will vibrate and won’t give a
            reward, by creating an aversive stimulus.
            <br />
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Types of activities</h3>
          <p class="bold">For cognititve and social skills:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li>Auditory activities:</li>
            <li class="sub">
              listening to calming music, nature sounds, or white noise
            </li>
            <li class="sub">
              detecting sounds: each cube will play a sound (one cube at a
              time). Children should try to tell what they hear.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exploring and learning colors, objects, animals, foods, emotions,
              movements, phrases, etc. . Different activities are possible here:
            </li>
            <li class="sub">
              Each cube will display one of the mentioned above (one cube at a
              time). Child should say what they see on the cube correctly. The
              system will detect whether their answer correlates with what is
              displayed on the cube.
            </li>
            <li class="sub">
              All cubes will display different elements from one category. An
              app that parents have will show one image from those that are
              displayed. Parent should tell/show it to the child and ask to
              touch the right image. As the child does so, system will recognize
              the cube and detect whether this answer is right. The cube will
              also play the sound of the image in case the selected topic was
              for example, animals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Matrix training - cubes will display different graphical symbols,
              images and words to teach word combination and messages. App will
              show a sentence/phrase, and a child should connect cubes in a way
              so that they create a desired sentence. As they touch and connect
              the cubes to each other, the cube will say the word/image that is
              displayed on it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p class="bold">For motor skills:</p>
          <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li>
              Exploring texture - screen on each cube will create different
              textures, like sand, feather, ground, bumps, ridges, fur, etc.
              through haptics. Children will touch each cube to explore the
              texture. This can help them to develop sense of touch and improve
              ability to identify and discriminate between different textures.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exploring temperatures - cubes will produce different temperatures
              that can be felt by touching the screen. This will help children
              to differentiate between temperatures.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix and match activities - children should match colors, textures,
              images, patterns etc that are displayed on the cubes.///IMAGES
              HERE!!!!!!!!
            </li>
            <li>
              Puzzles - all cubes will display different parts of a simple image
              or geometrical figure. Children should connect the cubes to each
              other to create a full image.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            These activities might not only be used in isolation - AI will
            create a combination of activities to target multiple senses to
            achieve desired outcomes. Additionally, AI will consider children’s
            preferences, conditions and interests when designing each activity.
